# ProcConfig

Configure proc-coefficients of most items.

- On-Kill Items proc-coefficients reduced to 0.

- Most other items proc-coefficients reduced to 0.1 - 0.25.

OnKillLimiter restricts on-kill procs.

- Restricted items : Gasoline, Will-o'-the-wisp, Ceremonial Dagger, and Shatterspleen.

- Restrictions are tracked for each individual player but are shared across restricted items.

- Restricted items prevent further on-kill effects from proccing in the area for a short duration.

- Delayed effects from restricted items also restrict an area for a duration, preventing daggers and explosions from endlessly chaining off themselves.

## Installation:

Requires Bepinex and HookGenPatcher.

Use r2modman or place inside of Risk of Rain 2/Bepinex/Plugins/
